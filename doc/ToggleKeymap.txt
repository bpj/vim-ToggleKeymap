*ToggleKeymap* - go back to the previously used ['keymap'][] value
==================================================================

This is a Vim plugin to simplify work with multiple [keymap files][|mbyte- keymap|] by providing commands to manipulate the buffer-local value of ['keymap'][] (thus activating another keymap file) while stashing the previous value:

1.  [Define some mappings][|:MapSetKeymap|] to [set the value of 'keymap'][|:SetKeymap|] while stashing its value in a [variable][|b:prevkeymap], 
2.  [Define mappings][|:MapToggleKeymap|] to [toggle 'keymap' back to its previous value][|:ToggleKeymap|] while stashing the current value of 'keymap' instead.
3.  [Also define mappings][|:MapNoKeymap|] to [set 'keymap' to an empty string][|:NoKeymap|] to not use any keymap file, while stashing the previous value of 'keymap'.
4.  [Define a |Dictionary| variable in your .vimrc][|g:mapkeymap|] to [batch define |:MapSetKeymap| mappings at startup][|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|] with less typing!

*ToggleKeymap-commands*
=======================

This plugin defines the following commands:

*:SetKeymap*
------------

Takes one argument: the new value to assign to ['keymap'][]:

    :SetKeymap {new-keymap-value}

Set the value of ['keymap'][]. The difference from `:setl keymap=mapname` is that it stashes the previous value of 'keymap' in the variable *b:prevkeymap* so that you can use [|:ToggleKeymap|][] or a mapping created with [|:MapToggleKeymap|][] to switch back and forth between the two values.

*:NoKeymap*
-----------

It is not possible to execute the [|:SetKeymap|][] command with an empty argument, so this calls the script-local function which |:SetKeymap| calls, with an empty string as argument, for you.

*:ToggleKeymap*
---------------

Provided you set the current value of ['keymap'][] with [|:SetKeymap|][] or [|:ToggleKeymap|][], or through a mapping created with [|:MapSetKeymap|][], [|:MapToggleKeymap|][] or [|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|][] this will toggle back and forth between the current and previous value of 'keymap' -- even if the previous value was empty.

*:MapSetKeymap*
---------------

This command takes two arguments:

1.  The key or key combination to [map][|key-mapping|].
2.  The value which the mapping shall set set ['keymap'][] to.

    :MapSetKeymap {key-to-map} {keymap-value}

Define a [|:SetKeymap|][]-aware [|key-mapping|][] pair (as in [|:nnoremap|][] and [|:inoremap|][]).  It actually defines a pair of key-mappings which call the same function as |:SetKeymap| calls, with {keymap-value} as argument.

*:MapNoKeymap*
--------------

This command takes one argument: the key or key combination to [map][|key-mapping|].

    :MapNoKeymap {key-to-map}

This command exists for the same reason as the [|:NoKeymap|][] command and relates to [|:MapSetKeymap|][] as |:NoKeymap| relates to [|:SetKeymap|][]; it calls calls the script-local function which |:MapSetKeymap| calls, with {key-to-map} as first argument and an empty string as second argument, for you.


*ToggleKeymap-autoload-functions*
===============================

Most of the commands listed above have corresponding [|autoload|][] functions which can be called with similar arguments. As you can see the command versions are mostly there to save on typing:

    Command                       Function
    ----------------------------  ------------------------------------
    :SetKeymap mapname            ToggleKeymap#SetKeymap(mapname)
    :ToggleKeymap                 ToggleKeymap#ToggleKeymap()
    :MapSetKeymap key name        ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymap(key, name)
    :MapToggleKeymap key          ToggleKeymap#MapToggleKeymap(key)

Additionally there is one function which can't have a corresponding command because its argument is not a string:

*ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()*
-----------------------

This function takes a single argument: a [|Dictionary|][]. An error message will be given if the argument is _not_ a Dictionary.

This function will call the same script-local function as [|:MapSetKeymap|][] calls one time for each `key : value` pair in the Dictionary, using the key as the key(s) to map and the value as the ['keymap'][] value to set.



*MapSetKeymap-modifying-variables*
==================================

There are three global variables which you can use to modify the behavior of [|:MapSetKeymap|][] (and [|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|][]):

*g:stashmapkeymap* 
-------------------

If set to a true value [|:MapSetKeymap|][] will add its arguments as a new `key : value` pair to [|g:mapkeymap|][]. Later you can use

    :put =string(g:mapkeymap)

to print g:mapkeymap to your .vimrc to redefine g:mapkeymap itself(!) or define a new set of arguments to [|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|][] to use for example when loading a certain filetype.


*g:mapkeymap*
-------------

If the variable |g:stashmapkeymap| exists and has a true value then every time [|:MapSetKeymap|][] is called (including when it is called by [|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|][]) its two arguments are saved as a `key : value` pair in the global variable |g:mapkeymap| (which thus must be a [|Dictionary|][], and is created if it doesn't already exist). This allows you to later use the command `:put =string(g:mapkeymap)` to write it to a script file (probably your [|.vimrc|][]) so that you can use it as argument to [|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|][] in your script.

You can of course write one function call command for every keymap you use:

    :call ToggleKeymap#MapNoKeymap('<LocalLeader>k0')     
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymap('<LocalLeader>ka', 'accents')
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymap('<LocalLeader>kg', 'greek')
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymap('<LocalLeader>kp', 'pinyin')
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymap('<LocalLeader>kr', 'russian-yawerty')

but this is a lot of typing, but if you are a person likely to use several languages and scripts in the same document keymaps is a limited domain where you are likely to define a bunch of mappings on a similar pattern. What if you instead of the above could do this to achieve the same effect:

    :let g:mapkeymapprefix = '<LocalLeader>k'
    :let g:mapkeymap = {

        \    '0'  :  "",
        \    'a'  :  'accents',
        \    'g'  :  'greek',
        \    'p'  :  'pinyin',
        \    'r'  :  'russian-yawerty',
        \ }
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict(g:mapkeymap)

Now isn't that much more readable? :-)

If you are like me you want to put in comments there as well, which makes for _very_ long lines without the dict trick!

    :let g:mapkeymapprefix = '<F11>'
    :let g:mapkeymap = {
        \   '0' : "",         " No keymap at all
        \   'g' : 'bpjgreek', " Beta Code drools! ;-)
        \   'l' : 'latin',    " Hochpotch mappings for Unicode 'Latin' letters and accents
        \   's' : 'sohlob',   " Accented letters as needed in the Sohlob project
        \   'x' : 'bxs',      " Modified CXS phonetic characters keymap
        \ }
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict(g:mapkeymap)
    :call ToggleKeymap#MapToggleKeymap(<F11><F11>)


*g:mapkeymapprefix*
-------------------

If this variable exists its value will be automatically prepended to every [|key-mapping|][] defined with [|:MapSetKeymap|][] or [|ToggleKeymap#MapSetKeymapFromDict()|][].

Suppose you execute the command

    :MapSetKeymap gr greek

With |g:mapkeymapprefix| _unset_ you will clobber the builtin [|gr|][], which you probably don't want to do.  One alternative is to change the above command to something like

    :MapSetKeymap <LocalLeader>kgr greek

but again that's a lot of typing!
